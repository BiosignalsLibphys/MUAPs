Welcome to the MUAPs GitHub repository, a dedicated space where we delve into the fascinating
world of Electromyography (EMG) decomposition. Our mission here is to explore and elucidate the
complex process of breaking down EMG signals into their constituent components, known as Motor Unit Action
Potentials (MUAPs). This endeavor is crucial for advancing our understanding of muscle function, 
neural control, and the intricate mechanisms that drive movement. By dissecting EMG signals, 
we aim to contribute to the fields of rehabilitation, clinical diagnostics, and biomedical research, 
providing insights that could lead to innovative treatments and technologies. Join us in this journey as 
we unravel the mysteries of EMG decomposition, share findings, and collaborate on this cutting-edge 
intersection of biology and technology.
